# gates

a gate is a check that is a program, not a prompt. it takes the text a step
produced and says pass or fail and why.

the reviewer is a prompt asking a model to be careful. a gate is a thing that
either matched or did not. they are for different jobs and i kept trying to
make the first one do the second.

## using them

    steps:
      - role: reviewer
        prompt: reviewer.md
        gates:
          - gate: regex
            pattern: "^## needs me"
          - gate: length
            max_lines: 40
          - gate: regex
            pattern: "TODO"
            present: false

results print under the step and land in `runs/<run id>/gates.md`. the journal
only hears about a gate that failed, because that one stops the run.

a step with no gates gets its heading in `gates.md` too, with `no gates`
under it, and its line in `steps.jsonl` says `"ungated": true` (see
`docs/journal.md`). without it, a step missing from `gates.md` could have
had no gates or never got as far as the check, and the file could not say
which.

## the seven

- **regex** - `pattern`, and `present: false` to require it is absent.
- **verdict** - an answer of `PASS` and `FAIL` lines. a line that starts with
  `FAIL` fails the step in any list shape (`- FAIL:`, `1. FAIL`, `**FAIL**`,
  any case), and so does one that starts with a word that is not a verdict
  (`UNVERIFIED`, `CANNOT CHECK`, `UNKNOWN`): a check nobody could do has not
  passed. what is left needs `passes` lines starting with `PASS` (default 1),
  so an answer in prose, or one that leaves a check out, fails too. an empty
  answer fails as `the step answered nothing`.
- **length** - `max_lines`, `min_lines`.
- **command** - `command: [...]`, with `{file}` replaced by a temp file holding
  the output. passes when the exit code matches `expect` (default 0). it runs
  in the run's `workdir` (see `docs/flows.md`), so it can check the work
  itself and not only what the step said about it. a `cold:` block gives it
  a shorter command for a change the risk map says is small (below).
- **red-test** - `marker` (default `FAILS:`) has to be in the output, or with
  `red: false` has to be gone from it. with `command: [...]` that is only the
  claim: the step names its test on a `TEST:` line, as a file or as
  `file::name` (whatever the command takes to run one test; only the part
  before `::` is looked for), the file has to exist in the run's `workdir`,
  and the command runs there with `{test}` replaced by the whole line. red
  passes on `expect` (default 1, a pytest run with a failing test) and on
  nothing else, so a test that passes, was never written, or was not
  collected is not red. `red: false` (or `"false"`, `no`, `0`) wants exit 0,
  and a step with no `TEST:` line of its own is held to the one the newest
  earlier step in the run named (red never borrows one: the step that says a
  test fails names it). a `red` that is neither true nor false fails. without a command the pass
  says nothing was run. an empty answer fails as `the step answered nothing`,
  not as a test that never failed.
- **coverage** - a cobertura xml report, `report` (default `coverage.xml`, read
  in the run's `workdir`), held to a floor from `project.yml` (see
  `docs/orchestrate.md`). `floor` names which one, `overall` (default) or
  `critical`; `critical` needs `paths`, the file patterns it covers. it counts
  lines, not branches, and a line is covered if any copy of it in the report
  was hit. it runs nothing, so the command that writes the report goes in a
  command gate before it. no `project.yml`, or one with no number for the
  floor, is a failure and not a pass.
- **reject** - the `immediate_reject` rules in `project.yml` that carry a
  `pattern`, searched for in the output with `^` and `$` meaning a line, as in
  `regex`. a match
  fails the step and names the rule. it takes no options: a pattern written on
  the gate is refused. it reads what the step produced, not the working tree,
  so it belongs on a step whose output is the change. no `project.yml`, or one
  where no rule has a pattern, is a failure and not a pass.

## a rule is checked only if it has a pattern

    standards:
      immediate_reject:
        - "business logic in an endpoint"
        - rule: "a debugger left in"
          pattern: 'breakpoint\(\)|pdb\.set_trace\('

the first is a sentence and stays one: no pattern means it, so it is still only
asked for. the second is the same kind of rule with a program behind it, and
the gate passes saying how many rules it checked and how many it could only
ask for, so the split stays visible.

## the number is not in the flow

    gates:
      - gate: command
        command: ["python", "-m", "pytest", "-q", "--cov", "--cov-report=xml"]
      - gate: coverage
      - gate: coverage
        floor: critical
        paths: ["billing/*"]

the flow says which report and which floor. what the floor IS comes from
`coverage:` in `project.yml`, and a number written on the gate is refused.
test-qa used to carry it as a sentence, where it could be read, agreed with and
then not met. it is a check now.

## why command matters

anything with a cli is a check now, without me writing an adapter. a linter, a
spell checker, a test runner, something that does not exist yet. the gate does
not know or care what it is - it looks at the exit code.

that is the whole extension point of this repo. if you want a check i have not
thought of, you do not write a plugin, you write a program.

`examples/tare-gate` is the one you can run: tare checks a written-up
draft for claims nobody sourced, and its exit codes already say passed, could
not run and refused (0, 1, 2), so the gate is a `command:` line and nothing
else.

fix-with-test is where it earns it. the closing step used to be a model reading
its own patch and saying the test passes now; it is `python -m pytest -q` and
an exit code, and a non-zero one stops the run. a `red: false` gate runs the
test the patcher names, or the worker's when it names none, and the verify
answer goes through
`verdict` with `passes: 3`, one for each thing it is asked to check.

## the short suite or the long one

    context:
      command: ["some-tool", "mcp"]
      tool: hotspots
      arguments: {dir: "."}
    steps:
      - role: patcher
        prompt: patcher.md
        gates:
          - gate: command
            command: ["python", "-m", "pytest", "-q"]
            cold:
              command: ["python", "-m", "pytest", "-q", "-m", "not slow"]
              threshold: 0.7

`command` is the long one. the files the step names are checked against the
ranking the `context:` block brought back (see `docs/mcp.md`), the same way
preflight checks them: when it names at least one and none is at `threshold`
(default 0.7), `cold`'s command runs instead. one hot file and the long one
runs. so does a run with no ranking - the server was down, the flow has no
`context:`, the step ran before the planner fetched it, the run was picked up
past the planner with `--resume`, or it is an eval run, which fetches none -
and a step that names no file at all, because none of those says the change
is small. `expect` and `{file}` mean the same for both commands, and the
result says which one ran and why.

it reads the files the step SAYS it touched, not the diff, so a step that
edits a hot file without naming it gets the short suite.
