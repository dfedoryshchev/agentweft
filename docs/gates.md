# gates

a gate is a check that is a program, not a prompt. it takes the text a step
produced and says pass or fail and why.

the reviewer is a prompt asking a model to be careful. a gate is a thing that
either matched or did not. they are for different jobs and i kept trying to
make the first one do the second.

## using them

    steps:
      - role: reviewer
        prompt: reviewer.md
        gates:
          - gate: regex
            pattern: "^## needs me"
          - gate: length
            max_lines: 40
          - gate: regex
            pattern: "TODO"
            present: false

results print under the step and land in the journal.

## the three

- **regex** - `pattern`, and `present: false` to require it is absent.
- **length** - `max_lines`, `min_lines`.
- **command** - `command: [...]`, with `{file}` replaced by a temp file holding
  the output. passes when the exit code matches `expect` (default 0).

## why command matters

anything with a cli is a check now, without me writing an adapter. a linter, a
spell checker, a test runner, something that does not exist yet. the gate does
not know or care what it is - it looks at the exit code.

that is the whole extension point of this repo. if you want a check i have not
thought of, you do not write a plugin, you write a program.
